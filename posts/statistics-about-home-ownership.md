Navigating the housing market can be an intimidating prospect for first-time homebuyers,
particularly millennials. This generation weathered the Great Recession during their
formative years and then faced the challenges of a global pandemic just as they were
gaining momentum in their careers and finances. Understandably, this has made them
cautious about entering the housing market. However, despite market uncertainties,
homeownership remains a crucial step in building long-term financial security. This is why
it's important to distinguish housing market myths from facts as you start your way up the
homeownership ladder. Here are a few data-driven myth-busters to help guide you:

## Myth 1: The housing market is headed for an imminent crash.

Frankly, there are too many people who want houses and too few houses
available for the housing market to crash anytime soon. This is a contrast to the conditions
that spurred the Great Recession, when there were too many homes and too few qualified
buyers. The low inventory of houses is also why houses are currently so expensive;
demand is higher than supply, which makes it a “seller’s market.”

Nonetheless, [recent studies](https://www.realtor.com/research/march-2024-data/) show housing inventory is steadily increasing (meaning more
homes are being built and more people are moving). In fact, compared to last year, the
availability of homes is up 23.5%, which contributes to stabilizing home prices. To reach a
fully balanced market, experts say the months of housing supply (the length of time it
would take to sell all the homes currently available) should be between five and six
months. As of February 2024, supply measured at 2.9 months, but it does continue to
[improve](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics/existing-home-sales).

## Myth 2: It’s best to buy a house when there is a drastic drop in interest rates.

Since the pandemic, interest rates have gone through significant changes. In 2020, the
government reduced [30-year mortgage interest rates](https://themortgagereports.com/61853/30-year-mortgage-rates-chart) to record lows of 3% in order to stabilize the economy. However, by 2023, rates soared up to 8%. (Remember: higher interest rates mean higher monthly payments on loans.) Now, with the job market and economy growing, the Federal Reserve is expected to [reduce interest rates](https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-inflation-prices-interest-rates-cuts-502ced8f228ee469f84fc6f2eeea6e3e).

All while high interest rates and low housing inventory can make housing prices
more expensive, experts generally advise that if you find your dream home, it's best to buy
now. With the right resources and programs, there's no need to wait to start building
equity in your home (or the portion of your home you own outright and can then use as an
asset). Also, with positive forecasts for inventory, interest rates, and inflation, the [number
of first-time homebuyers](https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2023-home-buyers-and-sellers-generational-trends-report-03-28-2023.pdf) is increasing.

## Myth 3: You need a high income and perfect finances to buy a home.

Buying a home is likely the largest purchase you’ll make in your lifetime. As a result, many
people believe they need to have a large down payment, a strong credit score, and no debt to buy a home. But the truth is there are many options and programs available to help low-
middle income families purchase a home, as well as ways to improve your finances
regardless of your situation. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is
dedicated to helping families secure financial support and gain the knowledge they need to
buy homes. This mission is increasingly important as HUD works to [reduce the racial
homeownership gap](https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/housing-finance-policy-center/projects/reducing-racial-homeownership-gap) and promote generational wealth building for all people.

While new initiatives are being put in place to meet an evolving housing landscape, HUD
has many existing [programs](https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/housing-counseling/special-initiatives-and-partnerships/) to help low-income families. These include the ["HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME)"](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/comm_planning/home) and the ["Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP)"](https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/shop/). Additionally, [Housing Choice Voucher programs](https://www.hud.gov/topics/housing_choice_voucher_program_section_8) support families in need. These vouchers are administered by local public housing agencies (PHAs) and can be used toward any housing that meets program requirements. These vouchers can help subsidize rent, ultimately allowing families to pay only a portion of the actual monthly cost. In some cases, individuals may even use the voucher to purchase a home with PHA approval.

Making any big investment can be nerve-wracking—especially for those who have grown
up with fluctuating markets—but purchasing a home is a vital step in achieving long-term
financial stability. Also, because fear stems from the unknown, it’s a great idea to meet with
HUD certified housing counselors to discuss your concerns, goals, and financial situation.
These counselors can serve as sounding boards and coaches throughout the entire homebuying journey. Find a [HUD certified housing counselor](https://hud4.my.site.com/housingcounseling/s/?language=en_US) today to get started.

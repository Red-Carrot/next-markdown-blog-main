## What You Need to Buy a Home:

## 5 Tips From a HUD-Certified Housing Counselor

There’s a lot that goes into buying a home. Of course, it can feel overwhelming. But [HUD
certified housing counselors](https://www.hud.gov/makehomethegoal) are here to help coach you toward your homeownership and financial goals. On average, people who add a housing counselor to their homebuying team have [$11,300 less household debt](https://www.hud.gov/makehomethegoal) than those who don’t. So, it’s safe to say HUD certified housing counselors know a thing or two about helping people achieve homeownership. Learn their five
tips on what you need to buy a home to get started on your homeownership goals:

## 1. Build a Team

There are many members of your homebuying team. Lenders, real estate professionals, advisors,
and even family and friends all help you win your dream home. Each person may offer their own
support or advice throughout the homebuying process. This makes it even more important that
you have a team you can trust. HUD certified housing counselors are unbiased members of your
homebuying team who can give you useful advice and help you find other trusted professionals.
With a strong team, you will be in a better position to plan your financial goals, navigate the
homebuying process, and ultimately secure the keys to your home.

## 2. Find the Right Programs and Take Advantage of Them

Buying a home is a large financial burden for many families. This can make homeownership feel
out of reach. But buying a home also comes with benefits that are the stepping-stone to a
stronger financial future. That’s why federal and local government agencies, nonprofits, and
private companies created programs to make homeownership more attainable.
[Government-sponsored loans](https://www.usa.gov/government-home-loans) like FHA loans, USDA loans, and VA loans, can help ease costs by lowering down payments, closing costs, and other mortgage requirements. There are also programs like Housing Choice Vouchers and [HUD Homes](https://www.hudhomestore.gov/), which allow consumers to purchase a previously foreclosed home at a discounted rate. Though many programs have income limits, there are also options for people outside of the low-to-moderate income status. Some [programs](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/sfh/reo/goodn/gnndabot) are even designed for certain professions like military members, teachers, or emergency medical technicians. Housing counselors will help you determine your unique eligibility and find the programs that are available to you.

## 3. Increase your Financial Education

Financial skills build the foundation for a smooth homebuying process. They not only help you
become a homeowner, but also help you stay a homeowner. Whether you want to create a game
plan to boost your credit score or better understand financial language for your homebuying
paperwork, strengthening your financial foundation will help you achieve your homeownership
goals. Before looking at properties, talk to a HUD certified housing counselor for all the
resources you need to start securing a successful financial future.

## 4. Prepare for Homeownership Costs

When people start preparing for homeownership, they usually start by planning for mortgage
costs and saving for the down payment. But those aren’t the only costs you need to consider
before moving in. Closing costs are fees paid at the end of your process for services you may not
think about initially. Lenders fees, costs for the home appraisal and home inspection, and
insurance fees are just some of the closing costs that homebuyers should expect. After securing
your keys, you should also pay attention to the repairs you may want to make for your new
home. This all might sound intimidating but don’t worry. HUD certified housing counselors help
you prepare so there are no financial surprises. They make sure you can close with confidence.

## 5. Verify All Documentation

Between loan agreements, applications, personal documents, and purchase contracts, there is a
lot of paperwork associated with homebuying. Something as small as a missed signature or
incorrect date can set you back weeks in your homebuying process. To be safe, check with your
housing counselor, real estate agent, or lender early on to make sure you have all the necessary
documentation and that you filled out all the paperwork correctly. This gives you time to correct
any errors and make sure you have everything you need to officially become a homeowner.

Buying a home is a big step, but it doesn’t have to be overwhelming. HUD certified housing
counselors help create a personalized step-by-step plan to give you all the tools you need to win
your home. Get started on your homeownership by contacting a HUD certified housing
counseling agency [local to you](https://hud4.my.site.com/housingcounseling/s/?language=en_US).
